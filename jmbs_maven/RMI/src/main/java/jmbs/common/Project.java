/**
 * Represents a Project
 * 
 * It has a String name, an Integer id and an ArrayList of User called users.\n
 * The array is left at null by default constructor because it would generate chained object creation if not.
 * (e.g) All the projects of a user are required by the client.\n 
 * Let n, the number of projects of that user and m the average number of users in a project. Clearly n << m \n
 * We would have n Projects created (Complexity in terms of database access: n) and n*m Users created which makes
 * a complexity of n*m >> nÂ². And in most case when a user requests the Projects he won't even take a look at the
 * users in it. \n
 * So we choose to set the ArrayList to null by default. You can fill it with external methods like @link {@link jmbs.server.ProjectDAO#getUsers(int) getUsers()} 
 * for the server part.
