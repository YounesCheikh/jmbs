/**
 * Represents a Project
 *
 * It has a String name, an Integer id and an ArrayList of User called users.\n
 * The array is left at null by default constructor because it would generate
 * chained object creation if not.\n
 * (e.g) All the projects of a user are required by the client.\n 
 * Let n, the number of projects of that user and m the average number of users 
 * in a project: Clearly n << m \n 
 * We would have n Projects created (Complexity in terms of database access: n) 
 * and n*m Users created which makes a complexity of n*m >> nÂ².\n
 * And in most case when a user requests the Projects he won't even take a look 
 * at the users in it.\n So we choose to set the ArrayList to null by default. 
 * You can fill it with external methods like
 * @link {@link jmbs.server.ProjectDAO#getUsers(int) getUsers()} for the server 
 * part.
